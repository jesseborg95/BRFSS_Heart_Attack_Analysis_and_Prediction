# BRFSS Heart Attack Data Exploratory Data Analysis and Model Prediction Project
Group project using R to analyze BRFSS Data from 2013. Exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and regression.

## Motivation
I performed this project as part of a group for an intro to data science class at the George Washington University. The requirements for the project were to perform exploratory data analysis and build models to make predictions based on the data, using a sizable dataset of your choice using R.

## Data Source
My group chose to analyze app store datasets found on the CDC Website (https://www.cdc.gov/).

## Using the Files
* The .csv files show the raw data used for the project.
* The .Rmd file shows all of my group's code. This file can be downloaded and knitted to get the final output.
* The .html file is the knitted R-Markdown file. Look at this if you are only interested in the output of the analysis. To view the rendered html file, go to http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jonathangiguere/App_Store_EDA_Project/blob/master/Project-Summary.html
